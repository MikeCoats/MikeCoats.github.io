      <p>For my second <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/weeknotes">#weeknotes</a> blogpost, I&apos;ve continued with last weeks &quot;theme&quot; of collecting up my browser searches and publishing the interesting bits. I spent most of my time this week either in meetings or at home waiting for a heating engineer, so I didn&apos;t actually have much time to do any searching for cool projects and instead I just ticked along some existing projects.</p>

      <p>One of the perks of working for <a href="https://www.nature.scot/">Scottish Natural Heritage</a> is that they encourage you to take a day per year and volunteer on a charitable project. This year some of the staff from <a href="https://twitter.com/SNH_Maps">our GIS team</a> organised a number of <a href="http://www.missingmaps.org/">Missing Maps</a> events, one of which I was lucky enough to find a place on. In case you&apos;ve never heard of Missing Maps or the work they do, I&apos;ve included a short video here.</p>

      <p>tl;dr Personal Weather Forecast is a small JavaScript program that mashes together Dark Sky&apos;s API with Twilio&apos;s APIs to produce a personally tailored weather forecast and sends it to you as a text message every morning. The source code is available as <a href="https://github.com/MikeCoats/personal-weather-forecast">a project on GitHub, here</a>.</p>

      <p>A common time-saving &apos;hack&apos; of mine when building &apos;new-but-related-to-old&apos; projects is to fork an existing code base and use it as the boot-strap for the new project. GitHub, however, does not provide the functionality on their website to fork your own project; you can only fork other people&apos;s projects. Here&apos;s how to work around that.</p>

      <p>For a quick lunch-time electronics project, I&#x2019;ve constructed an intruder alarm that can alert you any time somebody comes too close to your desk or cubicle. This project took me 45 minutes from start to finish including all coding, wiring and testing so&#x2014;provided you&#x2019;ve already got your lunch and eat it quickly&#x2014;you too can be alerted to approaching co-workers before your lunch hour is up.</p>
