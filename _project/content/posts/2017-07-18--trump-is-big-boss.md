# Trump is Big Boss

tl;dr Trump Is Big Boss is a silly little program that randomly generates fake tweet screenshots that attribute quotes from Metal Gear's Big Boss to @realDonaldTrump.

![Example tweet generated by Trump is Big Boss][tweet-screenshot]

The source code for the bot is [shared as a project on GitHub][github-project], and the resulting tweets are [posted to the parody account here][twitter-account].

This script is forked from my first proper Twitter bot, [The Jeremy Kylebot][kylebot-post]. The quotes the bot uses to generate tweets were orginally ripped by the user [Nekura_Hoka on GameFAQs][nekura-hoka], whose complete rip can be found on [the GameFAQs website][gamefaqs].
