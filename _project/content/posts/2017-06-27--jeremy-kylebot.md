# Jeremy Kylebot

tl;dr Jeremy Kylebot is a silly little program that randomly generates title cards in the style of The Jeremy Kyle Show and posts them to Twitter.

![Your Mum-in-Law Stole Their Kettle][tweet-screenshot]

The source code for the bot is [shared as a project on GitHub][github-project], and the resulting tweets are [posted to the parody account here][twitter-account].

I've tried to make the format of the show titles match the look-and-feel of genuine episodes, while at the same time I've made the subject of the titles as ludicrously "British" as possible.
