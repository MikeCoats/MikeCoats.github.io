# Weeknotes for 9th December 2019 - 15th December 2019

## Fàilte agus tapadh leibh, a charaid!

This one's a little late, but it's finally here; another [#weeknotes][weeknotes-twitter] report! This week was a different one for me as it was focused on learning rather than building.

## SEPA Visit

On Monday and Tuesday, a group of us from [SNH][snh] went to visit one of our sister agencies, [SEPA][sepa], as they've just released three new applications.

- [Register your private sewage treatment system][sepa-sewage]
- [Notify SEPA about the management of radioactive sources][sepa-radioactive]
- [Register your exempt waste activity][sepa-waste]

They've developed these applications following the [Digital First Service Standard][digital-first] and as we're about to build and release our own applications under it's successor, the [Digital Scotland Service Standard][digital-scotland], we were interested in discovering any lessons they had learned along the way. It was a really useful visit and we left with a lot to think about and to take in to our planning sessions.

## Tha thu sgoinneil! Is toil leam cèic agus cofaidh.

The rest of the week, as if you couldn't guess, has been taken up with learning [Gaelic with Duolingo][duolingo]. [The Daily Gael][daily-gael] set up [a campaign][scot-gael-duo] back in February to get Duolingo to support Gaelic learners with a course, and in November they [went live][duo-live]. Ever since, I've been logging in everyday to get my practice in. Hopefully, I'll soon be able to impress my office mates from [Bòrd na Gàidhlig][bord] at the tea point with a bit of "Am bu toil leat cofaidh?"

## Oidhche mhath, tìoraidh!
